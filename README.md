See [arXiv 2310.05013](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05013)


## Code Structure

- `.ipynb` files are the Jupyter notebooks for the figures.
- `.py` in the root directory are the main functions and classes.
- `.py` in the `scripts` folder stores the scripts for running the experiments and saving the result to the `output` folder.
  - temporary outputs are stored in `pickle` format.
